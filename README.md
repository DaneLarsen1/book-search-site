# MERN Challenge: Book Search Engine

## Overview
This project involves refactoring a fully functional book search engine that originally uses a RESTful API to leverage a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The application is part of the MERN stack, consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

## Objective
The goal is to transform the existing RESTful API to use GraphQL to enhance API calls and data manipulation. This includes setting up Apollo Server, modifying authentication middleware for GraphQL, creating an Apollo Provider for React, and deploying the application to Render.

## User Story
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a book search engine
WHEN I load the search engine
THEN I am presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button

## Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Knowledge of React, Express.js, and Apollo GraphQL

## Installation
1. Clone the starter code from the provided link.
2. Create a new repository and copy the cloned code into it (do not fork it).
3. Install the required npm packages by running;
   ```bash 
   npm install
4. Set up your MongoDB database.
5. Configure Apollo Server and update the existing API to use GraphQL queries and mutations.

## Usage
Start the server locally by running:
npm start
This will launch the application on localhost:3000 where you can interact with the interface to search, save, and manage books.

## Deployment
Follow these steps to deploy your application to Render:

## Create a new project on Render.
Link your GitHub repository.
Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the deployment settings.
